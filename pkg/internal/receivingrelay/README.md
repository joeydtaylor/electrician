# üì° Receiving Relay Package

The **Receiving Relay** package handles **incoming data streams** in Electrician, ensuring **secure, efficient, and scalable message ingestion** within distributed systems.

It provides **network listening, TLS security, and real-time data forwarding**, making it an essential component for **high-throughput, event-driven architectures**.

## üì¶ Package Overview

| Feature                       | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **gRPC-Based Communication**  | Handles **high-performance streaming and request/response** data exchange.    |
| **TLS Security**              | Supports **encryption and authentication** via **configurable TLS settings**. |
| **Flexible Output Routing**   | Routes messages to multiple downstream **Submitters** dynamically.            |
| **Compression Handling**      | Supports **ZSTD, Brotli, Snappy, LZ4, and Deflate** for bandwidth efficiency. |
| **Event Logging & Telemetry** | Provides **detailed structured logging and real-time monitoring**.            |

## ‚ö° Notable Dependencies

Electrician is **almost entirely built on the Go standard library**‚Äîwith two key exceptions:

1. **Logging:** Uses [Zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap), which is widely regarded as the best structured logger for Go.
2. **Compression:** Integrates **widely adopted compression libraries** (ZSTD, Snappy, Brotli, LZ4, Deflate) to **optimize bandwidth and processing efficiency**.

These external dependencies were chosen carefully to **maximize performance and minimize bloat**.

## üîß How Receiving Relays Work

A **Receiving Relay** acts as an **ingress point** for Electrician pipelines, **listening for messages** and **forwarding them to downstream consumers**.

### ‚úÖ **Core Responsibilities**

- **Data Reception:** Accepts incoming **gRPC messages** via direct calls or streaming.
- **Decompression Support:** **Unpacks compressed payloads** based on metadata.
- **TLS-Encrypted Communication:** Ensures **secure, authenticated transport**.
- **Dynamic Output Routing:** Forwards messages to **multiple destinations**.

### ‚úÖ **Lifecycle Management**

| Method            | Description                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Start()`         | Initiates the relay, **binding it to a network address**.         |
| `Receive()`       | Processes **single incoming messages** and sends acknowledgments. |
| `StreamReceive()` | Enables **continuous bidirectional streaming**.                   |
| `Stop()`          | Gracefully shuts down the relay, **closing all connections**.     |

## üîß Extending the Receiving Relay Package

To **modify or extend the Receiving Relay**, follow this **structured workflow**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Modify `types/`

- Define new methods inside `types/receivingrelay.go`.
- This ensures **all implementations remain consistent** across Electrician.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement in `api.go`

- The `api.go` file contains **public methods** ‚Äì update it accordingly.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Functional Option in `options.go`

- Supports **composable, declarative-style configuration**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Extend `notify.go` for logging & telemetry

- If new events are introduced, add **sensor and logger hooks**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Unit Testing (`receivingrelay_test.go`)

- **Validate reliability, performance, and network stability** under real-world conditions.
