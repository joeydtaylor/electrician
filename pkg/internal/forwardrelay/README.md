# üì° Forward Relay Package

The **Forward Relay** package enables **secure, high-performance data transmission** in distributed systems.  
It acts as a **message router**, forwarding data from **input sources** to **target destinations** over gRPC.

Forward Relays support **compression, TLS encryption, and configurable logging**,  
ensuring **reliable and efficient data forwarding** between system components.

## üì¶ Package Overview

| Feature                 | Description                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-Input Support** | Receives data from **multiple sources** (e.g., APIs, data streams).   |
| **High Throughput**     | Optimized for **parallel data processing and transmission**.          |
| **Compression Support** | Reduces bandwidth usage with **gzip, zstd, snappy, brotli, and LZ4**. |
| **TLS Encryption**      | Secures data transmission with **configurable TLS settings**.         |
| **Performance Tuning**  | Supports **batching, buffering, and rate control options**.           |

## ‚ö° Notable Dependencies

Electrician is **almost entirely built on the Go standard library**‚Äîwith two key exceptions:

1. **Logging:** Uses [Zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap), widely regarded as the best structured logger for Go.
2. **Compression:** Integrates **widely used compression libraries** (ZSTD, Snappy, Brotli, LZ4, Deflate)  
   to **optimize bandwidth and processing efficiency**.

These dependencies were chosen carefully to **maximize performance while minimizing external bloat**.

## üîß How Forward Relays Work

A **Forward Relay** acts as an **intelligent data router**,  
efficiently transmitting messages between services.

### ‚úÖ **Key Mechanisms**

- **Multi-Input Handling:** Receives data from **one or more sources**.
- **Compression Support:** **Reduces payload size** for optimized network performance.
- **Secure TLS Encryption:** Ensures **confidentiality and data integrity**.
- **Dynamic Performance Tuning:** Adjusts **batch sizes, compression, and concurrency**.
- **Event-Driven Logging & Monitoring:** Integrated with **Zap logger and sensors**.

### ‚úÖ **Lifecycle Management**

| Method           | Description                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Start()`        | Begins **data forwarding** from connected sources.   |
| `Stop()`         | Gracefully **terminates all forwarding operations**. |
| `ConnectInput()` | Attaches **one or more data sources** dynamically.   |
| `Submit()`       | **Forwards data** to target addresses securely.      |

## üîß Extending the Forward Relay Package

To **add new functionality**, follow this structured **workflow**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Modify `types/`

- Define the new **interface method** inside `types/forwardrelay.go`.
- This ensures **all implementations remain consistent**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement in `api.go`

- The `api.go` file must now implement the new method.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Functional Option in `options.go`

- Supports **composable, declarative-style configuration**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Extend `notify.go` for event logging

- If your change introduces **new events**, update **logging and sensor hooks**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Unit Testing (`forwardrelay_test.go`)

- **Ensure performance, event handling, and security are tested**.
