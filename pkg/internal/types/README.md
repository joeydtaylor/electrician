# ‚öôÔ∏è Types Package

The **types** package is the **source of truth** for all shared interfaces and fundamental data structures in Electrician.  
Every core component‚Äîincluding **Wires, Circuit Breakers, Sensors, Surge Protectors, and more**‚Äî**derives its contract from this package**.

Any **new functionality or extension** in Electrician **must first be defined here** before being implemented elsewhere.

## üîó Relationship with Other Packages

The **types** package is **foundational** to Electrician and directly influences every component:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Internal packages (e.g., `wire`, `circuitbreaker`, `sensor`)** must conform to these interfaces.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **The builder package (`pkg/builder/`)** wraps and exposes these types via a **user-friendly API**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **All components must implement these contracts** to ensure seamless interoperability.

By centralizing all **interfaces and contracts**, Electrician maintains **strict consistency and type safety**.

---

## üîß Modifying or Extending a Component

To **add new functionality** in Electrician, follow this structured **workflow**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Modify `types/`

- **Define the new interface method** in the appropriate file (e.g., `wire.go`, `circuitbreaker.go`).
- This ensures **all implementations remain consistent**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement in `api.go`

- The `api.go` file inside the respective **internal package** must now implement this method.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Functional Option in `options.go`

- Supports **composable, declarative-style configuration**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Extend `notify.go` for event logging (if applicable)

- If your change introduces **new events**, add corresponding **logging and telemetry hooks**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Unit Testing (`package_test.go`)

- **Write tests** to verify that the new functionality works as expected.

By following these steps, Electrician maintains **stability, compatibility, and strict type safety**.

## ‚ö° Standard Library First

Like most of Electrician, the **Types package is built entirely on Go‚Äôs standard library**.  
This ensures:

‚úÖ **Maximum compatibility** ‚Äì No unnecessary third-party dependencies.  
‚úÖ **Minimal attack surface** ‚Äì Secure and easy to audit.  
‚úÖ **High performance** ‚Äì Optimized for **low-latency, high-throughput pipelines**.

Electrician adheres to a **strict standard-library-first** philosophy, ensuring long-term maintainability.
